# RestaurantMenuConcept

Compared to my first iteration, I added more details to the state for this concept. Specifically, I added a price and description to the state to make better use of them in queries. Before, I had a generic type Dish, and a restaurantID but after having more experience with MongoDB and its state representation, it made more sense for me to just include them explicitly. Overall, the actions and queries are pretty similar (add/delete/get menu items), but I added an option to update menu items as well.

Overall, the core concept is the same, but I improved the wording, and added more functionality in terms of the update action.
