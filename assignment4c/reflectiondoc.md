# Project Reflections

Overall, I really enjoyed this assignment! It’s been quite a while since I built a full project completely from start to finish, so it felt really rewarding to bring something from an initial concept all the way to a functioning app. I also appreciated that the topic itself was something I found genuinely interesting, which made the process more engaging. That said, it was definitely a bit overwhelming at first. Most of the smaller projects I’ve worked on in the past didn’t require setting up a full back-end or managing so many moving parts at once. On top of that, I rarely build things entirely from scratch. I usually have some kind of template or base code to start from, so figuring out the structure of everything early on was a challenge. Once I got past that initial learning curve, though, it was really satisfying to see the app gradually come together piece by piece.

The hardest part early on was definitely staying organized. Keeping track of all the new files, figuring out where everything should go, and maintaining consistency across the project took a lot of effort. But that process also helped me build a much better understanding of how all the different components fit together. By the end, I felt a lot more confident navigating everything.

Through this assignment, I learned a ton of new technical skills. I practiced creating API endpoints, connecting a back-end with a database, building and using syncs, and working with Vue. Beyond just coding skills, I also learned a lot about how to plan, design, and troubleshoot a larger system. I think this kind of experience will be especially valuable in the future, since software engineers are likely to rely more on agentic tools that will automate tedious or repetitive parts of the process. This will make it easier to focus on higher-level design and creativity, which I enjoy.

That said, using these tools came with its own set of challenges. Debugging could be tricky, especially since the tools would sometimes produce code that looked correct but didn’t actually work. They were often confidently wrong, which made it harder to spot the real issue. Another challenge was making the final product feel more polished and unique. The auto-generated code was sometimes really inefficient or generic, and the front-end designs weren’t always appealing. Luckily, I was able to use what I already knew about web development to clean things up and make the app feel more cohesive.

I used Context a lot for brainstorming and planning, and Cursor for actually implementing and iterating on code. I found that working in small, manageable chunks was the best strategy since it helped prevent me from generating large blocks of broken or redundant code and made debugging much easier.

Overall, using Context and Cursor was a really interesting experience. I had never used any kind of agentic tooling before, and at first it felt a little strange. It was like stepping into a codebase I hadn’t written, even though I technically had. But once I got used to it, I really started to appreciate how these tools could enhance the development process. It felt like collaborating with a partner that could handle the tedious parts while I focused on making the app more thoughtful and well-designed which I liked!
