# Design Changes

When implementing Plateful, I realized that my original concepts weren’t as solid as I needed them to be once I started actually putting everything together. There were a few small situations where I had to go back and tweak some of the existing endpoints or even create new ones to make things work the way I wanted. For example, I updated a few response return types, added clearer and more helpful error messages, and introduced some new queries to handle extra use cases I hadn’t considered before.

The biggest change I made was to the RestaurantMenu concept. I ended up integrating the LLM into this concept through getRecommendation. At first, I thought about making this a completely separate concept, but after thinking through how everything connected, it made more sense to include it as a sync instead. This approach let me reuse the existing RestaurantMenu structure and the skeleton code I built in assignment 3, which saved time and kept things consistent. In the end, this setup gave me solid, well-defined concepts that worked well together and stayed independent.
