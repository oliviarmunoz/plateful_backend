# response:

This is a fantastic application idea! Breaking down the "What Should I Order?" app into concepts is a great way to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability. You're right that the recommendation engine is the core challenge.

Let's build upon your existing `UserAuthentication` and `Feedback` concepts and then design the necessary concepts for restaurants, menus, user preferences, and the recommendations themselves.

## Recap of Your Existing Concepts:

1. **`UserAuthentication`**
   * **concept**: UserAuthentication \[User]
   * **purpose**: Securely manage user accounts for access to application features.
   * **principle**: If a user registers with a username and password, they can later log in with those credentials to be authenticated.
   * **state**:
     ```
     a set of Users with
       a username String
       a password String
     ```
   * **actions**: `register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)`, `login (username: String, password: String): (user: User | error: String)`, `logout (user: User): Empty`

2. **`Feedback`**
   * **concept**: Feedback \[User, Item]
   * **purpose**: Allow users to express their approval or disapproval of items, contributing to collective ranking and personalized guidance.
   * **principle**: A user can submit a rating for an item, view their past ratings, update them, and delete them, with the system preventing duplicate submissions for the same user-item pair.
   * **state**:
     ```
     a set of Feedbacks with
       a author User
       a target Item
       a rating Number (e.g., 0-5)
       a timestamp Date
     ```
   * **actions**:
     * `submitFeedback (author: User, target: Item, rating: Number): (feedback: Feedback | error: String)`
     * `updateFeedback (feedback: Feedback, newRating: Number): Empty | (error: String)`
     * `deleteFeedback (feedback: Feedback): Empty | (error: String)`
   * **queries**:
     * `_getFeedbackByUserAndItem (user: User, item: Item): (feedback: {author: User, target: Item, rating: Number})[] | (error: String)`
     * `_getAllFeedbackByItem (item: Item): (feedback: {author: User, target: Item, rating: Number})[]`
     * `_getAllFeedbackByUser (user: User): (feedback: {target: Item, rating: Number})[]`

## New Concepts for "What Should I Order?"

### 3. `RestaurantCatalog`

* **concept**: RestaurantCatalog \[]
* **purpose**: Maintain a comprehensive and searchable catalog of restaurants with their essential information to enable user discovery.
* **principle**: If a restaurant's details (name, address, cuisine) are added to the catalog, users can successfully search for it and retrieve its up-to-date basic information.
* **state**:
  ```
  a set of Restaurants with
    a name String
    a address String
    a cuisineType String
    a description String (e.g., "Cozy Italian spot")
    a imageUrl String (link to restaurant image)
    a averageRating Number (derived from aggregated Feedback on its dishes)
  ```
* **actions**:
  * `addRestaurant (name: String, address: String, cuisineType: String, description: String, imageUrl: String): (restaurant: Restaurant | error: String)`
    * **requires**: No restaurant with the same name and address exists.
    * **effects**: Creates a new `Restaurant` entity with the provided details and an initial `averageRating` of 0.
  * `updateRestaurantInfo (restaurant: Restaurant, name: String?, address: String?, cuisineType: String?, description: String?, imageUrl: String?): Empty | (error: String)`
    * **requires**: `restaurant` exists.
    * **effects**: Updates the specified fields of the `restaurant`.
  * `deleteRestaurant (restaurant: Restaurant): Empty | (error: String)`
    * **requires**: `restaurant` exists.
    * **effects**: Removes the `restaurant` and all its associated data.
* **queries**:
  * `_getRestaurantDetails (restaurant: Restaurant): (restaurantInfo: {name: String, address: String, cuisineType: String, description: String, imageUrl: String, averageRating: Number})[] | (error: String)`
  * `_searchRestaurants (query: String, cuisineType: String?, minRating: Number?, limit: Number?): (restaurant: {id: Restaurant, name: String, address: String, cuisineType: String, averageRating: Number})[]`

***

### 4. `MenuItem`

* **concept**: MenuItem \[Restaurant, Dish]
* **purpose**: Manage the specific dishes available at each restaurant, including their descriptions, pricing, and key characteristics, to inform user choices.
* **principle**: After a chef adds a new "Spicy Pasta" dish with its price and tags to their restaurant's menu, users browsing that restaurant can see its details and understand its key attributes.
* **state**:
  ```
  a set of Dishes with
    a restaurant Restaurant
    a name String
    a description String
    a price Number
    a imageUrl String (link to dish image)
    a tags set of String (e.g., "spicy", "vegetarian", "gluten-free", "pasta", "dessert", "breakfast")
    a averageRating Number (derived from Feedback on this specific dish)
  ```
  * *Note*: `Dish` is a type parameter, its properties are defined *within* this concept.
* **actions**:
  * `addDish (restaurant: Restaurant, name: String, description: String, price: Number, imageUrl: String, tags: set of String): (dish: Dish | error: String)`
    * **requires**: `restaurant` exists; no dish with the same name exists for this `restaurant`.
    * **effects**: Creates a new `Dish` entity associated with the `restaurant` and its details, with an initial `averageRating` of 0.
  * `updateDishDetails (dish: Dish, name: String?, description: String?, price: Number?, imageUrl: String?, tags: set of String?): Empty | (error: String)`
    * **requires**: `dish` exists.
    * **effects**: Updates the specified fields of the `dish`.
  * `removeDish (dish: Dish): Empty | (error: String)`
    * **requires**: `dish` exists.
    * **effects**: Removes the `dish` from the menu.
* **queries**:
  * `_getDishesForRestaurant (restaurant: Restaurant): (dish: {id: Dish, name: String, description: String, price: Number, imageUrl: String, tags: set of String, averageRating: Number})[] | (error: String)`
  * `_getDishDetails (dish: Dish): (dishInfo: {restaurant: Restaurant, name: String, description: String, price: Number, imageUrl: String, tags: set of String, averageRating: Number})[] | (error: String)`
  * `_getDishesByTags (tags: set of String, limit: Number?): (dish: {id: Dish, name: String, restaurant: Restaurant, tags: set of String})[]`

***

### 5. `UserTasteProfile`

This concept is key to making recommendations "smarter" over time. It aggregates a user's preferences.

* **concept**: UserTasteProfile \[User, Dish]
* **purpose**: Maintain a dynamic, aggregated profile of a user's food preferences to serve as input for personalized recommendations.
* **principle**: When a user rates several "spicy" Thai dishes highly, their taste profile's "spicy" and "Thai" scores will increase, reflecting their growing preference for those attributes. The profile also remembers dishes they've tried.
* **state**:
  ```
  a set of UserProfiles with
    a user User
    a tasteScores map from String to Number (e.g., {"spicy": 0.8, "vegetarian": 0.5, "thai_cuisine": 0.7, "pasta_type": 0.6})
    a triedDishes set of Dish (identifiers of dishes the user has provided feedback on, and thus "tried")
  ```
  * *Note*: `tasteScores` can be dynamically generated or predefined categories. The system would map `MenuItem` tags (e.g., "spicy", "thai") to these scores.
* **actions**:
  * **system** `updateTasteProfile (user: User, dish: Dish, rating: Number, dishTags: set of String): Empty | (error: String)`
    * **requires**: `user` exists; `rating` is valid (e.g., 0-5). `dishTags` are relevant to the `dish`.
    * **effects**: Adjusts the `user`'s `tasteScores` based on the `rating` and `dishTags` (e.g., positive rating for "spicy" dish increases "spicy" score); adds `dish` to `user`'s `triedDishes`.
  * `deleteUserProfile (user: User): Empty | (error: String)`
    * **requires**: `user` exists.
    * **effects**: Removes the `user`'s taste profile.
* **queries**:
  * `_getTasteProfile (user: User): (profile: {tasteScores: map from String to Number, triedDishes: set of Dish})[] | (error: String)`

***

### 6. `DishRecommendation`

This concept computes the recommendation by leveraging data from `MenuItem` and `UserTasteProfile`.

* **concept**: DishRecommendation \[User, Restaurant, Dish]
* **purpose**: Generate personalized dish recommendations for a user at a given restaurant, optimizing for user preference and promoting discovery of new, appealing dishes.
* **principle**: Given a user and a restaurant, the concept analyzes the user's taste profile and the restaurant's menu to suggest the most suitable dish, ensuring it's one the user is likely to enjoy and possibly hasn't tried before.
* **state**:
  ```
  a set of RecommendationEvents with
    a user User
    a restaurant Restaurant
    a recommendedDish Dish
    a timestamp Date
    a rationale String (optional: "because you like spicy", "popular", "new")
  ```
  * *Note*: Storing `RecommendationEvents` allows tracking recommendations made, which can be useful for later analysis, UI history, and refinement.
* **actions**:
  * `generateRecommendation (user: User, restaurant: Restaurant, excludeTried: Boolean?): (dish: Dish, rationale: String | error: String)`
    * **requires**: `user` exists; `restaurant` exists; `restaurant` has available `MenuItem`s.
    * **effects**:
      * **Queries** `UserTasteProfile` to retrieve the `user`'s `tasteScores` and `triedDishes`.
      * **Queries** `MenuItem` to retrieve all `Dish`es for the `restaurant` along with their `tags` and `averageRating`.
      * Applies an internal recommendation algorithm:
        1. Filters out dishes if `excludeTried` is true and `dish` is in `triedDishes`.
        2. Scores each remaining dish based on how well its `tags` align with the `user`'s `tasteScores` and potentially the dish's `averageRating`.
        3. Selects the highest-scoring `Dish`.
      * Adds a new `RecommendationEvent` to its state.
      * Returns the selected `Dish` and a `rationale`. Returns an `error` if no suitable dish is found.
  * `deleteRecommendationEventsForUser (user: User): Empty | (error: String)`
    * **requires**: `user` exists.
    * **effects**: Removes all `RecommendationEvents` associated with the `user`.
  * `deleteRecommendationEventsForRestaurant (restaurant: Restaurant): Empty | (error: String)`
    * **requires**: `restaurant` exists.
    * **effects**: Removes all `RecommendationEvents` associated with the `restaurant`.
* **queries**:
  * `_getRecentRecommendations (user: User, restaurant: Restaurant, limit: Number?): (event: {recommendedDish: Dish, timestamp: Date, rationale: String})[]`
  * `_getRecommendationHistory (user: User, limit: Number?): (event: {restaurant: Restaurant, recommendedDish: Dish, timestamp: Date, rationale: String})[]`

## Example Synchronizations (Syncs)

Syncs are crucial for connecting these independent concepts.

### 1. Update User Taste Profile on Feedback Submission

This sync ensures that as users rate dishes, their taste profile is automatically updated.

```
sync UpdateTasteProfileFromFeedback
when
    Feedback.submitFeedback (author: u, target: d, rating: r)
where
    in MenuItem: _getDishDetails (dish: d) returns {tags: t}
then
    UserTasteProfile.updateTasteProfile (user: u, dish: d, rating: r, dishTags: t)
```

### 2. Update Dish Average Rating on Feedback Submission

This sync could update the `MenuItem`'s `averageRating` for a dish, which then influences future recommendations and general visibility.

```
sync UpdateDishAverageRating
when
    Feedback.submitFeedback (author: u, target: d, rating: r) OR
    Feedback.updateFeedback (feedback: f, newRating: r_new) AND
    (in Feedback: _getFeedbackDetails(f) returns {target: d, rating: r_old}) // Get old rating if update
where
    // (Calculation for new average rating for dish 'd' based on all its feedback)
    // This part might be complex and require a helper function or direct calculation in the sync handler
    // For simplicity in spec, assume a mechanism for calculating 'avg_r'
    calculateAverageRating(dish: d, newRating: r, oldRating: r_old) returns {new_average_rating: avg_r}
then
    MenuItem.updateDishDetails (dish: d, averageRating: avg_r)
```

*(Note: `calculateAverageRating` would be an external computation or a more complex `where` clause. For this level of spec, `calculateAverageRating` indicates the intent.)*

### 3. Cascade Deletion of Restaurant to Menu Items

When a restaurant is removed, all its dishes should also be removed.

```
sync CascadeRestaurantDeletionToMenuItems
when
    RestaurantCatalog.deleteRestaurant (restaurant: r)
where
    in MenuItem: _getDishesForRestaurant (restaurant: r) returns {id: d}
then
    MenuItem.removeDish (dish: d)
```

### 4. Cascade Deletion of Restaurant to Recommendation History

Clear out recommendation history related to a deleted restaurant.

```
sync CascadeRestaurantDeletionToRecommendations
when
    RestaurantCatalog.deleteRestaurant (restaurant: r)
then
    DishRecommendation.deleteRecommendationEventsForRestaurant (restaurant: r)
```

### 5. Cascade Deletion of User Data

When a user is deleted, all their associated data (feedback, taste profile, recommendations) should be removed.

```
sync CascadeUserDeletionToFeedback
when
    UserAuthentication.deleteUser (user: u) // Assuming UserAuthentication has a delete action
then
    Feedback.deleteAllUserFeedback (user: u) // Need to add this action to Feedback concept
```

```
sync CascadeUserDeletionToTasteProfile
when
    UserAuthentication.deleteUser (user: u)
then
    UserTasteProfile.deleteUserProfile (user: u)
```

```
sync CascadeUserDeletionToRecommendationHistory
when
    UserAuthentication.deleteUser (user: u)
then
    DishRecommendation.deleteRecommendationEventsForUser (user: u)
```

*(Self-correction: The `Feedback` concept would need a `deleteAllUserFeedback` action, which can be easily added.)*

## How the Recommendation Itself Works

The `generateRecommendation` action within the `DishRecommendation` concept encapsulates the core logic. It performs the following steps (internally, through queries, not calling actions):

1. **Get User Preferences**: It queries `UserTasteProfile` to retrieve the `user`'s `tasteScores` (e.g., their preference for "spicy," "vegetarian," "Italian cuisine," etc.) and `triedDishes`.
2. **Get Available Dishes**: It queries `MenuItem` to get all dishes for the specified `restaurant`, including their `tags`, `price`, and `averageRating`.
3. **Apply Recommendation Algorithm**:
   * **Filtering**: It first filters out dishes the user has `tried` (if the `excludeTried` flag is set).
   * **Scoring**: For each remaining dish, it calculates a "match score." This score would be a function of:
     * How well the dish's `tags` align with the `user`'s `tasteScores`. (e.g., if a dish is "spicy" and the user has a high "spicy" taste score, it gets a boost).
     * The dish's `averageRating` from `MenuItem` (popular dishes get a boost).
     * Potentially, other factors like `price` or novelty (if the user prefers trying new things).
   * **Selection**: It selects the dish with the highest match score.
4. **Record and Return**: It records this recommendation as a `RecommendationEvent` in its own state and returns the selected `Dish` (and a rationale) to the user.

This approach ensures that the `DishRecommendation` concept is independent and self-contained in its *behavior* (the algorithm), while *relying on data* (via queries) from other concepts. This aligns perfectly with the concept design principles.
