# response:

It appears the Concept Specification for "UserTastePreferences" has not been provided. The instructions describe the *structure* of a concept specification, but the actual content for `UserTastePreferences` is missing.

Please provide the full Concept Specification for `UserTastePreferences` (including its concept, purpose, principle, state, and actions/queries) so I can generate the API documentation as requested.
