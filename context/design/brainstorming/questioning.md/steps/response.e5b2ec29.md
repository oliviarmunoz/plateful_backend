# response:

The sky is blue primarily due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Sunlight is White Light:** The light from the sun appears white to us, but it's actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet â€“ ROYGBIV). Each color has a different wavelength, with red having the longest and violet/blue having the shortest.

2. **Earth's Atmosphere:** Our atmosphere is made of tiny gas molecules, primarily nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.

3. **Rayleigh Scattering:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with these tiny gas molecules. This causes the light to scatter in all directions. However, the amount of scattering depends on the wavelength of the light and the size of the particles it hits:
   * **Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered much more effectively** than longer wavelengths (red and yellow). This is because the tiny atmospheric molecules are roughly the same size as, or smaller than, the wavelengths of blue and violet light.
   * **Longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow) pass through the atmosphere more directly** with less scattering.

4. **Why Blue Dominates:** Because blue light (and violet) is scattered so much more efficiently in all directions, when you look up at the sky, you are seeing this scattered blue light coming from all parts of the atmosphere above you. Our eyes are also more sensitive to blue light than violet light, which is why we perceive the sky as blue, even though violet light scatters even more.

**In summary:** The sky is blue because the short-wavelength blue and violet light from the sun is scattered much more by the tiny gas molecules in our atmosphere than the longer-wavelength colors, making the blue light appear to come from all directions.
