# response:

To fix the `TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'error' in undefined`, we need to adjust how query results are checked for errors. The `_getLikedDishes` and `_getDislikedDishes` queries can return an empty array (`[]`) if a user exists but has no liked/disliked dishes. When an empty array is returned, `likedQueryResult[0]` evaluates to `undefined`, and attempting `"error" in undefined` causes the `TypeError`.

The fix involves making the error check conditional on the array not being empty. If the array is empty, it's considered a successful non-error state (just no results). If it's not empty, we then check if its first element (which would be an error object in an error case) contains an `error` property.

Here's the updated `src/concepts/UserTastePreferencesConcept/UserTastePreferencesConcept.test.ts` with the robust error checking for query results:
