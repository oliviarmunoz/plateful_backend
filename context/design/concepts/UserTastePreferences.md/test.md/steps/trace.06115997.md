# trace: Principle Fulfillment

This trace describes the `Principle: A user's liked dish preference is recorded` test step and how it's fulfilled.

**Concept Principle:** "when a user adds a dish to their liked list, that preference is recorded, influencing future recommendations"

**Trace Steps:**

1. **Initial State Check for User `user:Alice`:**
   * **Action:** `_getLikedDishes` for `user:Alice`.
   * **Requires:** `user:Alice` exists (concept ensures this by creating document on first `add` if not present, but for `_get`, it requires it to exist).
   * **Effects:** Returns `[]`.
   * **Verification:** `assertEquals(initialLiked, [], "User A should have no liked dishes initially.")`
   * **Expected:** The user `user:Alice` has no recorded liked dishes in the system.

2. **User `user:Alice` Likes Dish `dish:Pasta`:**
   * **Action:** `addLikedDish` with `{ user: "user:Alice", dish: "dish:Pasta" }`.
   * **Requires:**
     * `user:Alice` exists (ID valid). (The implementation will create the record if it doesn't exist yet).
     * `dish:Pasta` exists (ID valid).
     * `dish:Pasta` is not in `dislikedDishes` for `user:Alice`.
   * **Effects:**
     * If `user:Alice` record didn't exist, it's created with empty `likedDishes` and `dislikedDishes`.
     * `dish:Pasta` is added to `likedDishes` for `user:Alice`.
     * Returns `{}` (empty object for success).
   * **Verification:** `assertEquals(result, {}, "addLikedDish should return an empty object on success.")`
   * **Expected:** The action successfully processes, and the system records the preference.

3. **Verification of Recorded Preference:**
   * **Action:** `_getLikedDishes` for `user:Alice`.
   * **Requires:** `user:Alice` exists (now guaranteed after step 2).
   * **Effects:** Returns `[{ dish: "dish:Pasta" }]`.
   * **Verification:** `assertEquals(likedDishes, [{ dish: dish1 }], "Dish 1 should be in user A's liked dishes.")`
   * **Expected:** The query confirms that `dish:Pasta` is now correctly listed as a liked dish for `user:Alice`, demonstrating that the preference was recorded.

**Conclusion:** The sequence of actions (adding a liked dish) and subsequent query confirms that the user's preference is indeed recorded in the concept's state, directly fulfilling the described principle.
