# trace:

The following trace demonstrates how the **principle** of the `UserTastePreferences` concept is fulfilled by a sequence of actions.

1. **Given**: A user `userA`.
2. **Action**: `userA` adds `dish1` to their liked dishes.
   ```
   UserTastePreferences.addLikedDish({ user: "userA", dish: "dish1" })
   ```
3. **Result**: The action succeeds (`{}`), and `dish1` is recorded in `userA`'s liked dishes list.
4. **Verification**: Query `userA`'s liked dishes.
   ```
   UserTastePreferences._getLikedDishes({ user: "userA" })
   ```
5. **Result**: Returns `[{ dishes: "dish1" }]`, confirming `dish1` is liked.
6. **Action**: `userA` adds `dish2` to their liked dishes.
   ```
   UserTastePreferences.addLikedDish({ user: "userA", dish: "dish2" })
   ```
7. **Result**: The action succeeds (`{}`), and `dish2` is added to `userA`'s liked dishes.
8. **Verification**: Query `userA`'s liked dishes again.
   ```
   UserTastePreferences._getLikedDishes({ user: "userA" })
   ```
9. **Result**: Returns `[{ dishes: "dish1" }, { dishes: "dish2" }]` (order may vary), confirming both are liked.
10. **Action**: `userA` adds `dish1` to their disliked dishes.
    ```
    UserTastePreferences.addDislikedDish({ user: "userA", dish: "dish1" })
    ```
11. **Result**: The action succeeds (`{}`), `dish1` is added to `userA`'s disliked dishes, and *removed* from their liked dishes.
12. **Verification**: Query `userA`'s liked dishes.
    ```
    UserTastePreferences._getLikedDishes({ user: "userA" })
    ```
13. **Result**: Returns `[{ dishes: "dish2" }]`, confirming `dish1` was removed from liked.
14. **Verification**: Query `userA`'s disliked dishes.
    ```
    UserTastePreferences._getDislikedDishes({ user: "userA" })
    ```
15. **Result**: Returns `[{ dishes: "dish1" }]`, confirming `dish1` is now disliked.

This trace demonstrates that user preferences are dynamically recorded, updated, and moved between liked and disliked states, effectively building a taste profile that can be queried and would subsequently be used for personalized recommendations.
