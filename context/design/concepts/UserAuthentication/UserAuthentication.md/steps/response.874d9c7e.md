## concept: UserAuthentication \[User]

* **purpose**: To establish and verify the identity of individuals.
* **principle**: If a user registers with a unique username and password, they can later log in using those same credentials to prove their identity and gain access.
* **state**:
  * A set of `Users` with
    * a `username` of type `String`
    * a `password` of type `String` (representing the hashed password)
* **actions**:
  * `register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)`
    * **requires**: No `User` exists with the given `username`.
    * **effects**: Creates a new `User` and associates it with the provided `username` and `password`. Returns the newly created `User`.
  * `register (username: String, password: String): (error: String)`
    * **requires**: A `User` already exists with the given `username`.
    * **effects**: Returns an error message indicating that the username is already taken.
  * `login (username: String, password: String): (user: User)`
    * **requires**: A `User` exists with the given `username` and the provided `password` matches the stored password for that user.
    * **effects**: Returns the `User` associated with the valid credentials, indicating successful authentication.
  * `login (username: String, password: String): (error: String)`
    * **requires**: No `User` exists with the given `username`, or the provided `password` does not match the stored password for that `username`.
    * **effects**: Returns an error message indicating invalid credentials.
  * `logout (user: User)`
    * **requires**: The `user` must be a registered `User` within this concept.
    * **effects**: Revokes any active authentication state or tokens that this concept may have implicitly managed for the specified user, thereby ending its recognition of that user's authentication. (Note: This action implies the concept manages a form of active authentication state beyond just stored credentials, even if not explicitly detailed in the basic state for strict independence and completeness).
